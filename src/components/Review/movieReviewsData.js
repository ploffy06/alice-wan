        I love this movie and how it combines the ideas of overcoming fear and becoming a something more (a symbol, the Batman).
        It is also interseting how the movie doesn't necessarily show Bruce as a hero but rather more a traumatised child
        The soundtrack and casting for this movie and the entire trilogy is perfect. The movie also has so many unforgettable quotes
        that could only of been delivered perfectly by Bale.

        Joker's character is intersting as he is truly an agent of chaos and in some ways became the Joker because of the Batman.
        As Jim Gordon says, "We start carrying semi-automatics, they buy automatics. We start wearing Kevlar, they buy armor piercing rounds. And, you're wearing a mask.
        Jumping off rooftops." They are two sides of the same coin, which leads to the character Harvey Dent. His character is intersting as we begin by believing that
        he would become Gotham's White Knight but as he loses Rachel due to the corruption in the GCPD he becomes Two-Face.

        The movie was both exciting and heart-breaking. The part that saddended me the most was how Bruce continued to believe that Rachel chose to be with him
        when in fact she had chosen Harvey.

        It exciting to experience new and old faces. I loved Anne Hathaway's Catwoman and seeing Cillian Murphy's
        Scarecrow once more was a tease. Though this isn't my favourite out of the series, it was a great ending to the trilogy and
        reaasuring to see that Bruce no longer needed to be Batman.

        From the concept, to the cinematogarphy, the choreography, and acting, the movie is mind-blowing. Nolan has an ability to create unique concepts with
        emotional depth and this film captures that very well.

        This is probably my favourite Hayao Miyazaki movie as it not only has personal nostalgic touch to me but it is also an incredibly wounderours and fantastical movie.

        From the concept, the pacing, the plot twist to the thriller elements, I thouroughly enjoyed this movie. In a way I consider this a horror movie as I was quite
        terrified by the end of the film. I loved how this movie can be interpreted in many ways and makes you question who are the "parasites" and how are they parasitic.

        Wildly absurd yet intrigueing. The movie is set in a dystopian future that has a society centered around having a partner. The part that I found most poignant
        was the fact that in order to be in a relationship, the couple must share some trivial commonality such as having nosebleeds or being short-sighted. It's what leads
        to the protaganist at the end being pushed to blind himself to be with the woman he loves.

        I watched this movie with a decent amount of hope that it would be good but I was quite disappointed at the lost potential. The opening number was quite weak and none
        of the songs were particularly catchy. The overall theme vaguely appeared to be about dreams, hope and "the greedy beat the needy" but it wasn't portrayed very well.
        I believe the actors were amazing, the costuming and set design was quite exquisite but the writing was lacking.

        I am particularly fond of the dry humour and heartwarming nature of this movie. Morever, Ricky Baker is likable and hilarious. I love Taika Waititi's ability to portray
        the absurd parts of reality in a down-to-earth manner.

        I was completely engrossed the entire movie as Nolan captured and carried and sense of suspense all throughout the film. What makes Dunkirk unique is that it presents the
        ongoing chaos and having to always keep moving in order to survive.

        Not bad. Though I would contend with how realitic the characters are in how they act, the movie overall quite entertaining.

        I have no clue how to rate this film. I did enjoy the overall artistry and characters. The overall idea seems to be Emma Stone's character
        "breaking free from societal norms" as she discovers her sexuality. The part that I really take issue with is that the main character technically has
        the brain of a child and there was one scene where she has sex in front of children - this along with the film's obscenity makes me question the writer's intentions.
        I think this movie is slightly over-glorified.
