        I love this movie and how it combines the ideas of overcoming fear and becoming a something more (a symbol, the Batman). It is also interseting how
        Alfred balances Bruce and doesn't necessarily show Batman as a hero but rather more a traumatised child who's become the Batman for his own attention or
        adrenaline seeking purposes. The soundtrack and casting for this movie and the entire trilogy is perfect. The movie also has so many unforgettable quotes.

        Joker's character is interesting as he is truly an agent of chaos and in some ways became the Joker because of the Batman.
        As Jim Gordon says, "We start carrying semi-automatics, they buy automatics. We start wearing Kevlar, they buy armor piercing rounds. And, you're wearing a mask.
        Jumping off rooftops."

        The movie was both exciting and heart-breaking. The part that saddended me the most was how Bruce continued to believe that Rachel chose to be with him
        when in fact she had chosen Harvey.

        It exciting to experience new and old faces. I loved Anne Hathaway's Catwoman and seeing Cillian Murphy's
        Scarecrow once more was a tease. This movie, was fun.

        From the concept, to the cinematogarphy, the choreography, and acting, the movie is mind-blowing. Nolan has an ability to create unique concepts with
        emotional depth.

        This is probably my favourite Hayao Miyazaki movie as it not only has personal nostalgic touch to me but it is also an incredibly wounderours and fantastical film.

        From the concept, the pacing, the plot twist to the thriller elements, I thouroughly enjoyed this movie. In a way I consider this a horror movie as I was quite
        terrified by the end of the film. I loved how this movie can be interpreted in many ways and makes you question who are the "parasites" and how they are parasitic.

        Wildly absurd yet intrigueing. The movie is set in a dystopian future that has a society centered around having a partner. The part that I found most poignant
        was the fact that in order to be in a relationship, the couple must share some trivial commonality such as having nosebleeds or being short-sighted.

        I am particularly fond of the dry humour and heartwarming nature of this movie. Morever, Ricky Baker is likable and hilarious. I love Taika Waititi's ability to portray
        the absurd parts of reality in a down-to-earth manner.

        I was completely engrossed the entire movie as Nolan captured and carried and sense of suspense all throughout. What makes Dunkirk unique is that it presents the
        ongoing chaos and having to always keep moving in order to survive.

        I have no clue how to rate this film. There are some interesting concepts but also some questionable ones, in a sense of "what was the real intention of the writer?".
