        I love this movie and how it combines the ideas of overcoming fear and becoming a something more (a symbol, the Batman).
        It is also interseting how the movie doesn't necessarily show Bruce as a hero but rather more a traumatised child
        The soundtrack and casting for this movie and the entire trilogy is perfect. The movie also has so many unforgettable quotes
        that could only of been delivered perfectly by Bale.

        Joker's character is intersting as he is truly an agent of chaos and in some ways became the Joker because of the Batman.
        As Jim Gordon says, "We start carrying semi-automatics, they buy automatics. We start wearing Kevlar, they buy armor piercing rounds. And, you're wearing a mask.
        Jumping off rooftops." They are two sides of the same coin, which leads to the character Harvey Dent. His character is intersting as we begin by believing that
        he would become Gotham's White Knight but as he loses Rachel due to the corruption in the GCPD he becomes Two-Face.

        The movie was both exciting and heart-breaking. The part that saddended me the most was how Bruce continued to believe that Rachel chose to be with him
        when in fact she had chosen Harvey.

        It exciting to experience new and old faces. I loved Anne Hathaway's Catwoman and seeing Cillian Murphy's
        Scarecrow once more was a tease. Though this isn't my favourite out of the series, it was a great ending to the trilogy and
        reaasuring to see that Bruce no longer needed to be Batman.

        From the concept, to the cinematogarphy, the choreography, and acting, the movie is mind-blowing. Nolan has an ability to create unique concepts with
        emotional depth and this film captures that very well.
