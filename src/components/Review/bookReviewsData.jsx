      Though I assume that the war and training scenes were described in an almost robotic manner to emphasise
      the rapidity of the military and war, I found it mediocre and difficult to evoke strong imagery.
      I did, however, enjoy the parts where Mandella was on Earth or the planet Heaven, away from the war (ironic).

      Beautiful. The langauge used was evocative and I especially adored the imagery for Akiko's mystic appearance.
      I enjoyed the bizzareness of UFOs and each member coming from a different planet.

      However, I wish the book delved more into where the UFOs came from and what it meant for the Osugi family to
      have come from different planets. I also sensed that the ending was rushed and ended in a way that it
      felt as though the book was unfinished. But, for me, Yukio's writing made up for this unsatisfying ending.

      I love this book. Murakami's style of writing is elegant, evocative and descriptive such that
      when I read, its as though my eyes are gliding along each line seamlessly. A simple plot, with moments of intense
      drama and grief, Murakami has created a truly stunny masterpiece.

      The concept is really fascinating and brings out the fear and potential reality of books being tabboo in society. The symbolism
      of fire initially sparks the idea of destruction but later brings forward warmth and light - a compelling contrast. My only critique
      is the overuse of repetition in this book.

      What would you do if you could momentarily travel back in time? This book presents
      complex relationships between characters with heartwarming motivations to travel back
      in time. It is a short, light, fast-paced story and I enjoyed it.

      Very perculiar and eerie. This books can be either read as an Orwellian dystopia or an
      allegory for dementia. I found it interesting how the citizens, including the protaginist,
      play a role in the disappearance of items through their compliance. Even towards the end as
      everyone begins losing body parts, the protaginist does not appear to be in utter distress but rather
      nonchalant about the idea of being reduced to a singular voice. I rate this a 3.5 because I felt some parts
      of the story was slow-moving and redundant but the overall concept was interesting.

      An informative introduction on what it takes to successfully build a long-term startup. In this book, Thiel
      brings in many interesting case studies and his own experiences. In particular he gives seven questions
      that every business must answer as a strong guideline for beginners.

      This science fiction novel portrays a realistic story through combining physics concepts with human motivations.
      I found some parts of the novel intriguing, especially the character Ye, and i enjoyed the overall premise. I may consider
      reading the rest of the series.

      Very exciting. The book is much better than the series. I love seeing the politics and character motives unravel.
      My personal favourite is Tyrion, though who doesn't love him. I found the third person limited
      omniscient of different characters to be an interesting method of story-telling. Can't wait to read the
      rest of the series.

      This is a detailed and engaging "history-lesson" of how we came to understand and apply our knowledge of the gene.
      I learnt a lot reading this book.

      The ideas, concept and science of fungi life is increidbly interesting. However, to me the book fell short of the actual facts and science
      and seems to go into too much dramatization of the ideas. I felt quite disappointed reading this.
