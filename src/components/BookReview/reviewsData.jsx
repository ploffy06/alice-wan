      Though I assume that the war and training scenes were described in an almost robotic manner to emphasise
      the rapidity of the military and war, I found it mediocre and difficult to evoke strong imagery.
      I did, however, enjoy the parts where Mandella was on Earth or the planet Heaven, away from the war (ironic).

      Beautiful. The langauge used was evocative and I especially adored the imagery for Akiko's mystic appearance.
      I enjoyed the bizzareness of UFOs and each member coming from a different planet.

      However, I wish the book delved more into where the UFOs came from and what it meant for the Osugi family to
      have come from different planets. I also sensed that the ending was rushed and ended in a way that it
      felt as though the book was unfinished. But, for me, Yukio's writing made up for this unsatisfying ending.

      I love this book. Murakami's style of writing is elegant, evocative and descriptive such that
      when I read, its as though my eyes are gliding along each line seamlessly. A simple plot, with moments of intense
      drama and grief, Murakami has created a truly stunny masterpiece.

      description: `
      The concept is really fascinating and brings out the fear and potential reality of books being tabboo in society. The symbolism
      of fire initially sparks the idea of destruction but later brings forward warmth and light - a compelling contrast. My only critique
      is the overuse of repetition in this book.
